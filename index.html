    <p id="letter">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry<br>.
     Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br>
      when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br>
       It has survived not only five centuries,<br> but also the leap into electronic typesetting,<br>
        remaining essentially unchanged.<br> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset<br>
         sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,<br> and more recently with desktop publishing software like <br>
         Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum</p>
